# CrowdPay Backend API

## Interactive Swagger UI

In development, browse the interactive API docs at `GET /api/docs`.

## Important Notes

### Timestamps
All timestamps (like campaign deadlines) **must be in ISO 8601 format with a UTC timezone indicator (Z suffix)**, e.g., `2026-12-31T23:59:59.999Z`. The server will treat all timestamps as UTC for validation and storage.

### Public API lifecycle
`GET /api/v1/changelog` returns the v1 changelog without authentication. To announce a sunset, configure both `PUBLIC_API_DEPRECATION_DATE` and `PUBLIC_API_SUNSET_DATE` as ISO 8601 timestamps, with the sunset later than the deprecation date. The v1 API will then include the RFC 9745 `Deprecation` header, the HTTP-date `Sunset` header, and a `Link` to the changelog on every response. Leave either variable unset to avoid announcing a deprecation.

## Contribution conversion model

- Campaigns define a default settlement asset via `campaigns.asset_type` (`USDC` or `XLM`).
- Contributors can pay using `send_asset`.
- If `send_asset !== campaign.asset_type`, the backend uses Stellar `pathPaymentStrictReceive` so the campaign receives the exact requested `amount` in its settlement asset.
- Conversion path discovery uses Stellar Horizon `strictReceivePaths` and applies a `5%` slippage buffer when computing `sendMax`.
- Additional credit assets can be enabled through `STELLAR_EXTRA_ASSETS` in `.env` as a JSON object (`{"CODE":"ISSUER"}`).

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/users/me`

Authenticated. Returns the current profile, including `email_verified` (boolean), `kyc_status` (`unverified`, `pending`, `verified`, `rejected`) and `kyc_completed_at`.

### `GET /api/users/verify-email`

Public. Validates a verification token and marks the associated user's email as verified.

Query params:
- `token` (required): The UUID token sent via email.

Returns `200` on success or `400/410` if the token is invalid or expired (> 24 hours).

### `POST /api/users/resend-verification`

Authenticated. Generates a new verification token and sends a new email.
Rate-limited to 3 requests per hour per user.

### `POST /api/users/me/kyc/start`

Authenticated. Creates a hosted KYC session with the configured provider and marks the user `pending`.

Response includes `redirect_url` or `session_token`, plus the updated user. Persona is used when `KYC_PROVIDER=persona`, `PERSONA_API_KEY`, and `PERSONA_TEMPLATE_ID` are configured; otherwise local development returns a dev redirect URL.

### `POST /api/webhooks/kyc`

KYC provider callback. Updates the matched user to `verified` or `rejected` from provider status. The campaign creation gate is controlled by `KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_CAMPAIGNS` and defaults to enabled; set it to `false` for testnet/dev.

### `POST /api/campaigns`

Authenticated creator/admin endpoint. The user must have `email_verified=true`. Additionally, when `KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_CAMPAIGNS` is not `false`, the user must have `kyc_status=verified`; otherwise the API returns `403` with `code=KYC_REQUIRED` or `code=EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`.

### `GET /api/contributions/quote`

Get a DEX quote before submitting a conversion contribution.

Query params:

- `send_asset` (required): `XLM` or `USDC`
- `gift` (optional): `{ recipient_name, recipient_email, message? }`. The
  recipient is notified only after the Stellar payment is confirmed and
  indexed. `recipient_name` is limited to 100 characters, `recipient_email`
  must be valid, and `message` is limited to 280 characters.

Gift notifications are written to a database-backed outbox in the same
transaction that records the confirmed contribution. Email delivery retries
with exponential backoff; registered recipients also receive an in-app
notification. Gift data is not added to the public contribution response.
- `dest_asset` (required): `XLM` or `USDC`
- `dest_amount` (required): amount the campaign should receive

Success response (`200`):

```json
{
  "send_asset": "XLM",
  "dest_asset": "USDC",
  "dest_amount": "9",
  "quoted_source_amount": "10.0000000",
  "max_send_amount": "10.5000000",
  "estimated_rate": "0.900000000000000",
  "path": ["AQUA"],
  "path_count": 3
}
```

Errors:

- `400` missing/invalid params
- `404` no path found on Stellar DEX

### `POST /api/contributions`

Submit a contribution through the existing custodial wallet flow (direct payment or path payment).

Body:

- `campaign_id` (required)
- `amount` (required): amount the campaign must receive in campaign asset
- `send_asset` (required): `XLM` or `USDC`

Success response (`202`):

```json
{
  "tx_hash": "c8d6...",
  "message": "Transaction submitted",
  "conversion_quote": {
    "send_asset": "XLM",
    "campaign_asset": "USDC",
    "campaign_amount": "4.5000000",
    "quoted_source_amount": "5.0000000",
    "max_send_amount": "5.2500000",
    "path": []
  }
}
```

`conversion_quote` is `null` for direct same-asset contributions.

Errors:

- `400` missing fields / unsupported assets
- `404` campaign not found or not active
- `422` no conversion path found for requested asset pair

### `POST /api/contributions/prepare`

Prepare an unsigned Stellar transaction for a Freighter contribution without submitting it.

Body:

- `campaign_id` (required)
- `amount` (required): amount the campaign must receive in campaign asset
- `send_asset` (required): `XLM` or `USDC`
- `sender_public_key` (required): contributor wallet public key from Freighter

Success response (`200`):

```json
{
  "unsigned_xdr": "AAAAAgAAA...",
  "prepare_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "conversion_quote": null,
  "sender_public_key": "G...",
  "network_passphrase": "Test SDF Network ; September 2015",
  "network_name": "TESTNET"
}
```

`prepare_token` is short-lived and must be returned with the signed XDR to `/api/contributions/submit-signed`.

Errors:

- `400` missing fields / invalid Stellar public key / unsupported asset
- `404` campaign not found or not active
- `422` no conversion path found for requested asset pair

### `POST /api/contributions/submit-signed`

Submit a Freighter-signed contribution transaction after backend validation.

Body:

- `prepare_token` (required): opaque token returned by `/prepare`
- `signed_xdr` (required): transaction signed in Freighter

Success response (`202`):

```json
{
  "tx_hash": "c8d6...",
  "stellar_transaction_id": "0f3f...",
  "message": "Transaction submitted",
  "conversion_quote": null
}
```

Validation performed before submission:

- signed transaction source account must match `sender_public_key`
- signed transaction body hash must match the prepared unsigned XDR exactly
- signed transaction must contain a valid signature for the contributor public key

Errors:

- `400` missing fields / invalid prepare token
- `403` prepare token belongs to a different authenticated user
- `422` signed XDR does not match the prepared transaction
- `502` Stellar rejected the signed transaction

### `GET /api/anchor/info`

Returns the configured fiat on-ramp anchors and the CrowdPay asset codes currently enabled on Stellar.

### `POST /api/anchor/deposits/start`

Authenticated. Starts a SEP-24 hosted deposit session for the chosen anchor after backend SEP-10 authentication.

Body:

- `campaign_id` (required)
- `amount` (required): amount the campaign should ultimately receive
- `anchor_id` (required): anchor identifier from `/api/anchor/info`

Success response includes:

- anchor session `id`
- `interactive_url`
- `anchor_transaction_id`
- `anchor_asset` / `anchor_amount`
- `conversion_quote` when the eventual contribution needs a path payment

### `GET /api/anchor/deposits/:id`

Authenticated. Polls the anchor transaction, updates the local anchor session, and once the deposit completes automatically submits the normal Stellar contribution from the user’s custodial wallet.

### Anchor environment configuration

Anchor deposit support requires a configured backend anchor signing wallet and an enabled anchor.
Set `ANCHOR_WALLET_HOME_DOMAIN` and `ANCHOR_WALLET_SIGNING_SECRET` in the backend environment.
MoneyGram anchor support is enabled by default unless `ANCHOR_MONEYGRAM_ENABLED=false`.
Use `ANCHOR_MONEYGRAM_ENV=sandbox|preview|production` to select the MoneyGram deployment.

For a custom anchor, configure `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_ID`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_NAME`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_HOME_DOMAIN`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_SEP24_ENDPOINT`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_SIGNING_KEY`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_ASSET_CODE`, and `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_ASSET_ISSUER`.

### `GET /api/contributions/campaign/:campaignId`

Fetch indexed contributions with conversion audit fields.

Success response (`200`):

```json
[
  {
    "id": "0f3f...",
    "sender_public_key": "G...",
    "amount": "4.5000000",
    "asset": "USDC",
    "payment_type": "path_payment_strict_receive",
    "source_amount": "4.9973210",
    "source_asset": "XLM",
    "conversion_rate": "0.900482150000000",
    "path": ["AQUA"],
    "tx_hash": "c8d6...",
    "created_at": "2026-04-23T08:13:34.392Z"
  }
]
```

### `GET /api/withdrawals/capabilities`

Returns whether the authenticated user may perform **platform** signing/rejection (`can_approve_platform`). If `PLATFORM_APPROVER_USER_ID` is set in the backend environment, only that user’s JWT subject matches; otherwise (dev only) any authenticated user may act as platform for API calls.

### `POST /api/withdrawals/request`

Create a pending withdrawal request (creator only). Verifies multisig on the campaign wallet, ensures the campaign is `active` or `funded`, and rejects if another `pending` withdrawal already exists for the same campaign.

Body:

- `campaign_id` (required)
- `destination_key` (required)
- `amount` (required)

Returns `201` with withdrawal request (`creator_signed=false`, `platform_signed=false`, `status=pending`).

Appends an audit row to `withdrawal_approval_events` with action `requested`.

Errors:

- `403` not the campaign creator
- `409` campaign status not eligible, or duplicate pending withdrawal
- `422` multisig configuration invalid

### `POST /api/withdrawals/:id/approve/creator`

Creator approval step. Signs withdrawal XDR using creator custodial key and marks `creator_signed=true`.

Errors:

- `403` caller is not campaign creator
- `409` request no longer pending, campaign status not `active`/`funded`, or already creator-approved

Logs `creator_signed` in `withdrawal_approval_events`.

### `POST /api/withdrawals/:id/approve/platform`

Platform approval/finalization step. Signs with platform key, validates dual-signature presence, and submits to Stellar.

Errors:

- `403` caller cannot perform platform signature (see `PLATFORM_APPROVER_USER_ID`)
- `409` creator approval missing, campaign status not eligible, or request not pending
- `422` insufficient signatures in XDR
- `502` Stellar rejected the transaction — request is marked `failed` and `submit_failed` is logged

Success:

- marks request as `status=submitted`
- stores Stellar `tx_hash`
- logs `platform_signed` in `withdrawal_approval_events`

### `POST /api/withdrawals/:id/cancel`

Creator-only. Cancels a **pending** request **before** creator signature (`creator_signed=false`). Sets `status=denied` and stores optional `reason` in `denial_reason`. Logs `creator_cancelled`.

### `POST /api/withdrawals/:id/reject`

Platform-only (same rules as platform approve). Rejects a **pending** request **after** creator has signed and **before** platform signature. Sets `status=denied`. Body optional: `{ "reason": "..." }`. Logs `platform_rejected`.

### `GET /api/withdrawals/campaign/:campaignId`

List withdrawal requests for a campaign (`denial_reason` included when denied). **Authorized for campaign creator or configured platform approver only** (others receive `403`).

### `GET /api/withdrawals/:id/events`

Immutable audit timeline for one withdrawal: `action`, `actor_user_id`, `note`, `metadata`, `created_at`. Same authorization as the campaign list endpoint.

### `GET /api/milestones/campaign/:campaignId`

List milestones for a campaign in display order.

Success response (`200`):

```json
[
  {
    "id": "0f3f...",
    "campaign_id": "4db6...",
    "title": "Prototype delivery",
    "description": "Ship the first production-ready prototype to pilot users.",
    "release_percentage": "25.0000",
    "sort_order": 0,
    "status": "pending",
    "evidence_url": null,
    "destination_key": null,
    "review_note": null,
    "created_at": "2026-04-26T08:13:34.392Z",
    "completed_at": null,
    "approved_at": null,
    "released_at": null
  }
]
```

### `POST /api/milestones/:id/submit`

Creator-only. Submit milestone completion evidence and the payout destination for that release.

Body:

- `evidence_url` (required)
- `destination_key` (required): Stellar public key that will receive the approved release

Errors:

- `403` caller is not the campaign creator
- `409` campaign is not yet in a releaseable state, or milestone is already released
- `400` destination key is invalid

### `POST /api/milestones/:id/approve`

Platform-only. Reviews the submitted milestone, signs the escrow withdrawal using the existing dual-signature flow, submits it to Stellar, records the withdrawal, and advances campaign status to `in_progress` or `completed`.

Body:

- `reason` (optional): review note stored with the milestone and audit trail

Errors:

- `403` caller cannot perform platform approval
- `409` evidence or payout destination is missing, campaign status is not `funded`/`in_progress`, or release already exists
- `422` dual signature requirements were not met
- `502` Stellar rejected the release transaction

### `POST /api/milestones/:id/reject`

Platform-only. Rejects a submitted milestone and stores a required review note.

Body:

- `reason` (required)

## Sponsor matching

Sponsor matching lets a sponsor pledge a pool of funds that is released contribution by contribution. Full behaviour, limits and operational notes live in [`docs/sponsor-matching.md`](../docs/sponsor-matching.md).

### `POST /api/campaigns/:id/matches`

Authenticated. Creates a matching pledge for the campaign.

```json
{ "match_ratio": 1, "pledge_amount": "1000" }
```

- `match_ratio` — match multiplier in `(0, 100]` (`1` is 1:1, `2` is 2:1).
- `pledge_amount` — positive amount in the campaign asset, below `1e13`.

Returns `201` with the created pledge row. `400` on validation failure, `404` when the campaign does not exist, and `409` with `code: "DUPLICATE_MATCHING_PLEDGE"` when the caller already holds an active pledge for this campaign (enforced by a partial unique index, so concurrent duplicate requests are deterministic) or `code: "CAMPAIGN_NOT_MATCHABLE"` when the campaign is closed.

### `GET /api/campaigns/:id/matches`

Public. Aggregated pool progress for the campaign widget and the campaign page:

```json
{
  "campaignId": "…",
  "matches": [
    {
      "id": "…",
      "sponsorName": "Alice",
      "matchRatio": 1,
      "pledgeAmount": 1000,
      "matchedAmount": 250,
      "remainingAmount": 750,
      "status": "active",
      "contributionCount": 2,
      "totalContributed": 250,
      "createdAt": "…"
    }
  ],
  "totalPledged": 1000,
  "totalMatched": 250,
  "remainingPoolAmount": 750,
  "activePoolCount": 1,
  "exhaustedPoolCount": 0,
  "percentageUsed": 25
}
```

Sponsor user IDs are deliberately omitted — this endpoint is unauthenticated.

### `PATCH /api/campaigns/:id/matches/:matchId/complete`

Authenticated. Closes a pledge so unspent funds become reclaimable. Only the sponsor or the campaign creator may call it (`403` otherwise, `404` for an unknown pledge, `409` when it is already completed).

### `GET /api/user/sponsor-matches`

Authenticated. Every pledge held by the caller across all campaigns.

## Embeddable campaign progress widget

### `GET /api/campaigns/:id/widget`

Public, permissive CORS, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=30`. This is the single payload rendered by the iframe embed at `/embed/campaigns/:id` and by the script at `/embed-widget.js`.

```json
{
  "id": "…",
  "title": "Solar grid",
  "description": "Community owned solar",
  "raised_amount": 5000,
  "target_amount": 10000,
  "asset_type": "USDC",
  "status": "active",
  "contributor_count": 25,
  "days_remaining": 10,
  "progress_percentage": 50,
  "contribution_url": "https://…/campaigns/…",
  "milestones": [
    { "id": "m-1", "title": "Design", "release_percentage": 50, "sort_order": 0, "status": "released" }
  ],
  "milestone_summary": { "total": 2, "released": 1, "approved": 0, "submitted": 0, "pending": 1 },
  "recent_backers": [{ "name": "Alice", "amount": 250 }],
  "impact": { }
}
```

Privacy and safety notes:

- Only public summary fields are returned — no creator or contributor identifiers, wallet addresses, emails, or transaction hashes.
- Hidden and soft-deleted campaigns return `404`.
- `recent_backers` honours the campaign's `show_backer_amounts` flag and each contributor's `contributor_privacy` preference (`anonymous` contributors are never listed, `amount_only` contributors never leak a display name, and hidden amounts are returned as `null`).
- `GET /api/embed/:campaignId/stats` remains available for backwards compatibility but is not used by the widget.

## Auditability and traceability

- Every indexed contribution stores:
  - `payment_type` (`payment` vs `path_payment_strict_receive`)
  - destination settlement `amount` and `asset`
  - conversion source `source_amount` and `source_asset` (when applicable)
  - `conversion_rate` (`destination_amount / source_amount`)
  - conversion `path` as JSON
  - immutable Stellar `tx_hash`
- This enables independent reconciliation against Horizon payment records by `tx_hash`.

- Manual fund releases append rows to `withdrawal_approval_events` (`requested`, `creator_signed`, `platform_signed`, `creator_cancelled`, `platform_rejected`, `submit_failed`) with optional `note` and `metadata` JSON for audit and manual review.

- Milestone-based releases reuse the same multisig withdrawal machinery, but the release is triggered from platform approval after the creator has submitted evidence and a payout destination.

- Anchor-assisted contributions persist `anchor_id` and `anchor_transaction_id` on the final `contributions` row for support and reconciliation.

## Ledger monitor health

### `GET /health/ledger`

Public JSON snapshot for operations: Horizon **cursor** row per active campaign wallet (from `ledger_stream_cursors`), in-process **SSE stream state** (`connected`, `reconnecting`, `error`, `not_connected`), last message time, reconnect attempt count, and `stale_stream_no_messages_15m` when a supposedly connected stream has had no SSE traffic for 15 minutes.

The backend also logs a **warning** every 5 minutes if any wallet is in that stale state.

## Test coverage

`node --test src/**/*.test.js` includes route coverage for:

- quote endpoint success
- quote endpoint no-path behavior
- direct payment path for `XLM -> XLM`
- direct payment path for `USDC -> USDC`
- conversion path payment for `XLM -> USDC`
- conversion path payment for `USDC -> XLM`
- withdrawal request creation with multisig validation
- withdrawal creator/platform approval flow
- withdrawal denial paths (missing creator approval, insufficient signatures)


## Creator payout forecast and reserve breakdown

Both endpoints require authentication and are scoped to the campaign's creator
(or a platform admin). They read live data from `campaigns`,
`contributions`, `withdrawal_requests`, `recurring_payout_schedules`, and
`treasury_policies`. No write side effects.

### GET /api/creator/campaigns/:campaignId/payout-forecast

Query parameters:

| name    | type    | default | bounds  |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| horizon | integer | 6       | 1 .. 24 |

Response fields:

- campaign_id, asset_type, horizon_months
- opening_balance, reserve_today, available_today
- projected_total_payout
- months[]: { month, projected_payout, projected_balance_after, payouts[] }
- reserve_breakdown: { platform_fees, pending_withdrawals, scheduled_payouts, unallocated_reserve }
- constraints: { min_hold_days, max_single_withdrawal_pct, withdrawal_cooldown_hours, require_auditor_for_above, wallet_mode, contract_id }
- generated_at

Errors: 401 unauthenticated, 403 not creator/admin, 404 unknown campaign,
422 horizon out of range.

### GET /api/creator/campaigns/:campaignId/reserve

Returns the reserve breakdown without walking the horizon. Same reserve_breakdown
and constraints shape as the forecast, plus campaign_id, asset_type, balance,
reserve, available, scheduled_payouts[], generated_at.

### Reserve semantics

reserve is capped at balance and equals:

- platform_fees        - unsettled platform fee on non-refunded contributions
- pending_withdrawals  - withdrawals in any pending state
- scheduled_payouts    - one run per active recurring schedule
                         (fixed amount, or percentage * balance when amount is null)

unallocated_reserve = reserve - (fees + pending + scheduled), always >= 0; it is
only non-zero when the balance cap kicked in.

### Forecast semantics

Deterministic projection, not a guarantee. Each month consumes the next run of
each active schedule, capping a payout at the remaining projected balance.
projected_total_payout is the sum across the horizon. No new funds, fees, or
refunds are assumed.

# Data Model

This document outlines the core foundational data models for CrowdPay: Users, Campaigns, and Contributions.

## Entities

- **Users**: Represents the platform users, including campaign creators.
- **Campaigns**: Represents funding campaigns created by users. Each campaign is tied to a specific target amount and asset on the Stellar network.
- **Contributions**: Represents individual payments made to a campaign. It handles path payment conversion details when applicable.

## Contribution Pools (#600)

The `contribution_pools` and `pool_members` tables enable group contributions where multiple users pool funds into a single larger contribution.

### `contribution_pools`

| Column         | Type            | Description                                    |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| id            | UUID (PK)      | Unique pool identifier                         |
| campaign_id   | UUID (FK)      | Target campaign for the pooled contribution    |
| leader_id     | UUID (FK)      | User who created and manages the pool          |
| title         | TEXT           | Pool name displayed to members                 |
| description   | TEXT           | Optional description of the pool goal          |
| target_amount | NUMERIC(20,7)  | Total contribution goal for the pool           |
| raised_amount | NUMERIC(20,7)  | Sum of all confirmed member shares             |
| status        | TEXT           | open, closed, submitted, cancelled             |
| expires_at    | TIMESTAMPTZ    | Optional deadline for joining the pool         |
| created_at    | TIMESTAMPTZ    | Creation timestamp                             |
| updated_at    | TIMESTAMPTZ    | Last update timestamp (auto via trigger)       |

**Indexes:**
- `idx_contribution_pools_campaign` on `campaign_id`
- `idx_contribution_pools_leader` on `leader_id`
- `idx_contribution_pools_status` on `status`

### `pool_members`

| Column         | Type            | Description                                    |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| id            | UUID (PK)      | Unique membership identifier                   |
| pool_id       | UUID (FK)      | Reference to contribution_pools (CASCADE)      |
| user_id       | UUID (FK)      | Reference to users                             |
| share_amount  | NUMERIC(20,7)  | Amount this member pledges to the pool         |
| display_name  | VARCHAR(50)    | Optional public name shown in pool             |
| status        | TEXT           | pending, confirmed, declined                   |
| contributed_at| TIMESTAMPTZ    | When the member's share was confirmed          |
| created_at    | TIMESTAMPTZ    | Membership creation timestamp                  |

### `contributions` additions

| Column             | Type            | Description                                    |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| pool_id           | UUID (FK)      | If set, this contribution was made via a pool  |
| pool_share_amount | NUMERIC(20,7)  | This member's individual share of the pool     |

### Pool Flow

1. A user (pool leader) creates a pool for a campaign with a `target_amount`.
2. Other users join the pool by pledging a `share_amount` (status: `pending`).
3. The leader confirms members (status: `confirmed`).
4. When the pool reaches its target, the leader submits it.
5. The backend records the pooled contribution as a single transaction from the leader,
   with each member's share tracked via `pool_id` and `pool_share_amount`.
## Campaign Translations (#602)

The `campaign_translations` table allows creators to provide campaign descriptions in multiple languages.

| Column       | Type            | Description                              |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| id          | UUID (PK)      | Unique translation identifier            |
| campaign_id | UUID (FK)      | Reference to campaigns (CASCADE)         |
| language    | TEXT           | Language code (e.g. es, fr, ja)          |
| title       | TEXT           | Translated campaign title (max 255)      |
| description | TEXT           | Translated campaign description          |
| created_at  | TIMESTAMPTZ    | Creation timestamp                        |
| updated_at  | TIMESTAMPTZ    | Last update timestamp                     |

**Unique constraint:** `(campaign_id, language)` — one translation per language per campaign.

## Feature Flags (#800)

The `feature_flags` table backs the runtime flag endpoints in
`backend/src/routes/featureFlags.js`. Its canonical shape is declared both in
the migration `backend/db/migrations/20260906_feature_flags.sql` and in
`backend/db/schema.sql`, which now match so `migrate:fresh` converges.

| Column            | Type            | Description                               |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| key               | TEXT (PK)       | Flag identifier (kebab-case)              |
| enabled           | BOOLEAN         | Runtime state                             |
| default_enabled   | BOOLEAN         | Fallback when row is absent               |
| description       | TEXT            | Human-readable purpose                    |
| updated_at        | TIMESTAMPTZ     | Last modification time                    |

**Partial index:** `api_keys_user_active_idx ON api_keys (user_id) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL`.
